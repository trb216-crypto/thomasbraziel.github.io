  <h4>M&G Chemicals Mechanic’s Liens (3x+ Return)</h4>
  <p>
    In 2017, we acquired mechanic’s lien claims in the M&G USA Corp bankruptcy for approximately <strong>30% of face value</strong>. These liens were secured under Texas constitutional law and sat high in the capital structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the plant was sold as part of the bankruptcy auction, our claims were repaid in full — resulting in a <strong>3x+ return in under 12 months</strong>. A classic short-duration, high-yield distressed trade.
