  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I’ve been fascinated by business and investing from a young age — the kind of kid who started businesses out of the garage and bought his first stock at 12. That first decade of investing? Let’s just say it was more about curiosity than success.
  </p>

  <p>
    My earliest trades? Home Depot, after reading a long HBR piece on Bob Nardelli’s culture overhaul. EMC, trading at 7x earnings. And NICO — inspired by a Foreign Affairs article on the future of nickel demand. Did I have any idea what I was doing? Not really. But I was hooked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, I lost interest in traditional stock picking and became obsessed with applying mathematics to markets. After a brief stint in consulting (which I hated), I went back to Columbia to study applied math in finance. That’s where everything changed.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day, wandering the university bookstore, I picked up a dusty copy of the <em>10th Edition of Security Analysis</em>. Graham’s ideas hit me like lightning — this was it. From that point on, I was locked in: special situations, deep value, distressed, and bankruptcy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then, I've built a career investing where others don’t look. I co-founded and ran a hedge fund focused on special sits for 6 years, delivering <strong>19%+ net annualized returns</strong> to LPs. My work spans bankruptcy trade claims, debtor-in-possession loans, distressed paper, and obscure litigation assets. I live in the corners of the market — and I love it there.

    <h3>Track Record Highlights</h3>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>Ethanex Energy (20x+ Return)</h4>
      <p>
        Purchased 567,500 shares in Ethanex Energy (EHTE.PK) at $0.04/share during its liquidation. Over time I acquired over 25% of the company. The investment returned over 20x capital — from $20,000 to over $500,000 — on a total company liquidation value of $7.1M.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>Mt. Gox Bankruptcy (14x Return)</h4>
      <p>
        Acquired several million in Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims between 2014 and 2016. Positions were purchased at steep discounts with expected multi-bagger BTC payouts. This investment has been profiled by Grant’s, Bloomberg, and more.

<div class="highlight">
  <h4>FTX Claims (150%+ Recovery in 2 Years)</h4>
  <p>
    Starting in late 2022, I began acquiring FTX bankruptcy claims when they were trading at just <strong>6¢ on the dollar</strong>. Many saw chaos — I saw optionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next 18 months, the case evolved faster than anyone expected. Thanks to aggressive asset recovery and crypto market tailwinds, recoveries are now expected to exceed <strong>150% of face</strong>. What started as a “pennies on the dollar” trade turned into one of the most asymmetric distressed opportunities in years.

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>M&G Chemicals Mechanic’s Liens (3x+ Return)</h4>
      <p>
        In 2017, we acquired mechanic’s lien claims in the M&G USA Corp bankruptcy for approximately <strong>30% of face value</strong>. These liens were secured under Texas constitutional law and sat high in the capital structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the plant was sold as part of the bankruptcy auction, our claims were repaid in full — resulting in a <strong>3x+ return in under 12 months</strong>. A classic short-duration, high-yield distressed trade.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="highlight">
  <h4>Belmond (4x+ Return, Acquired by LVMH)</h4>
  <p>
    In 2018, I invested in Belmond Ltd (NYSE: BEL), a global portfolio of ultra-luxury hotels and trains, including iconic assets like the Cipriani in Venice. Despite 40%+ EBITDA margins, the stock had languished for years due to corporate entrenchment and a poison-pill provision.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Belmond bought out Sherwood’s rights and announced a strategic review, the trade became a classic “variant perception” case. With a cost basis around $7 and a takeout price over $25 from LVMH, this was a <strong>4x+ return</strong> with a short time horizon.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key insight: this wasn’t just about value. It was about <em>optionality</em> — trophy assets with global “sheikh appeal” in a bidding war environment where prestige sometimes trumps price.

      <h4>507 Capital (Fund Track Record)</h4>
      <p>
        Ran a hedge fund focused on bankruptcy claims, distressed lending, and claims trading. Generated 19%+ net IRR over a 6-year period. Deals included DIP loans, mechanic's liens, and estate cleanups across the U.S. and globally.
