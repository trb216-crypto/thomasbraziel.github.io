    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm an investor focused on distressed and special situations. I ran a hedge fund for 6 years,
      generating over <strong>19% net annualized returns</strong> to LPs. I specialize in complex bankruptcy
      claims and overlooked value opportunities. My investing experience includes bankruptcy trade
      claims, debtor-in-possession financing, distressed loans, legacy certificates, and niche litigation claims.

    <h3>Track Record Highlights</h3>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>Ethanex Energy (20x+ Return)</h4>
      <p>
        Purchased 567,500 shares in Ethanex Energy (EHTE.PK) at $0.04/share during its liquidation. Over time I acquired over 25% of the company. The investment returned over 20x capital — from $20,000 to over $500,000 — on a total company liquidation value of $7.1M.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>Mt. Gox Bankruptcy (14x Return)</h4>
      <p>
        Acquired several million in Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims between 2014 and 2016. Positions were purchased at steep discounts with expected multi-bagger BTC payouts. This investment has been profiled by Grant’s, Bloomberg, and more.

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>M&G Chemicals Mechanic’s Liens (3x+ Return)</h4>
      <p>
        In 2017, we acquired mechanic’s lien claims in the M&G USA Corp bankruptcy for approximately <strong>30% of face value</strong>. These liens were secured under Texas constitutional law and sat high in the capital structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the plant was sold as part of the bankruptcy auction, our claims were repaid in full — resulting in a <strong>3x+ return in under 12 months</strong>. A classic short-duration, high-yield distressed trade.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>Belmond (Acquired by LVMH)</h4>
      <p>
        Participated in the special situations equity trade on Belmond prior to its acquisition by LVMH. Strategy was featured on SumZero. Exemplifies our approach: opportunistic and value-driven.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h4>507 Capital (Fund Track Record)</h4>
      <p>
