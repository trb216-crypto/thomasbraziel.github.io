  <h3>BitClave Advisory Engagement</h3>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p>
      In early 2025, I was brought in by a group of BitClave ($CAT) ICO claimants facing near-total losses. Their tokens were illiquid, the claims process was opaque, and most had written off their positions as worthless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over several weeks, I worked with the group to reconstruct their pooled token holdings from fragmented wallets, incomplete exchange records, and Telegram archives. We coordinated dozens of claimants globally — many of whom had no formal records — and rebuilt a full proof package for submission.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Verified token vesting schedules & chain provenance</li>
      <li>Consolidated investor positions held across exchanges and cold wallets</li>
      <li>Negotiated the claim structure directly with estate counsel</li>
      <li>Protected the group from dilution, rejection, or misallocation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What started as “zero expected recovery” now looks like a win: over <strong>$2 million in distributions</strong> are expected for the group — from nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don’t just invest — we go to work when most walk away.
